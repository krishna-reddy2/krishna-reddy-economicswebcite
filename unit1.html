<h2> factors of production</h2>
<p> 1.	The act of using goods and services to satisfy human wants is called consumption.</p>
<p> 2.	Production means creation of utilities.</p>
<p> 3.	Exchange means exchange of goods for money or money for goods.</p>
<p> 4.	Distribution of income among the owners of 4 factors of production is called distribution.</p>
<p> 6.	All the goods and services which are helping to produce some other goods are called factors of production.</p>

</ul>
<p> 1.	Micro means small. Micro economics studies individual units of economy.</p>
<p> 2.  Macro means big. Macro economics studies aggregate and averages of entire economy.</p>
<p> Q 1:	What are economic activities? How they differ from non – economic activities?<br>(or)
	Distinguish between economic activities & non–economic activities ?</p>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> Economics is the science which studies the economic activities of man and of the community.</p>
<p> All people are at work. They work in order to earn money. After earning  money they are spending that money to buy goods and services.</p>
<p> This type of income earning and income spending activities are called economic activities.</p>
<p> The various activities performed by an individual are broadly classified into 2 types. They are</p>
<ul>
<li>1.	Economic activities.</li>
<li>2.	Non – economic activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any effort made by an individual (physical or mental) with intension to earn something in return is called an economic activity.</p>
<h2> Meaning of economic activities</h2>
<h2>definition of economic activities</h2>
<dl>
<dt> definition of economic  activities</dt>
<dd>According to J.R. Hieks, “The activities which involve income earning or spending through exchange of goods and services are called as economic activities.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Objectives of economic activities:</h2>
<p> a)	The primary object of economic activity as far as a single individual is concerned earning of income.</p>
<p> b)	As far as the society is concerned the object of economic activity is to accelerate the growth of output of goods and services year after year. Such growth of output is necessary to raise the standard of living of people.</p>
 <p> c)	From the point of view of a country, the objectives of economic activities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>1.	To produce larger and greater output of goods and services (GNP) year after year.</li>
<li>2.	To raise the level of employment and achievement of full employment of labour and resources.</li>
<li>3.	To promote welfare of people by reducing inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth.</li>
<li>4.	To maintain economic stability.</li>
  <h3>Classification of economic activities</h3>
<p>Bonding classified economic activities into 4 types. They are</p>
<ul>
<li>1 consumption</li>
<li>2 production</li>
<li>3 exchange</li>
<li>4 distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities form the subject matter of economics.</p>
<h2>1. Consumption:</h2> 
<p>If wants are the starting point of economic activity, consumption is the end of such activity. The act of using goods and services to satisfy human wants is called consumption. The people who are using the goods are called consumers. Consumers have to make decisions regarding what goods are to be consumed (purchased) and in what quantities. We analyze the objectives,<br> motives and behaviour of individuals in their consumption decisions.</p>
 <h2>2. Production:</h2>
<p> In economic production means creation of utilities. Goods are produced by business firms. A firm is a collection of factors of production or productive resources.<br>Firms buy productive resources from households and produce goods. They decide what goods shall be produced and in what quantities and for whom goods shall be produced. Firms produce goods on the basis of consumers demand.</p>
<h3> 3. Exchange:</h3>
<p> Exchange is a kind of conversion of goods. One gives what he has in abundance for what he does not process. Exchange takes place when goods are sold in the market. Firms sell goods and consumers buy goods in the market.</p>
 <h3> 4. Distribution:</h3>
<p>In economics distribution of income among the owners of 4 factors of production is called distribution. It is concerned with sale of services by factors of production. Resource owners sell factor services to firms. Firms pay prices to factor units. Distribution is merely the pricing of services of factors of production.</p> 
<h2>2. Non economic activities meaning:</h2>
<p>	If the purpose of activity does not involve income earning or spending or exchange it is called non-economic activity.</p>
<h3>Types of non economic activities:</h3>

<p>	An individual performs apart from economic activities several other activities such as physical activities, political activities, social activities, religious activities etc. All these activities are called non-economic activities as they do not involve any earning or spending of incomes.</p>
<h3>1. Physical activity:</h3>
<p>Doing exercise early in the morning is a physical activity that keeps an individual fit mentally and physically but does not give rise to any earning or spending.</p>
<h2>2. Political activity:</h2>
<p>  As a citizen of his country, he participates in elections or chooses to become an elected member of assembly or parliament or village panchayat. He may become member of a political party. These activities are called political activities.</p>
<h3>3. Social activity:</h3>
<p>Man is a member of a social group. He visits his friends and relatives houses and participates in social functions. He renders social service in times of war, natural calamities etc. These are social activities.</p>
<h4>4. Religious activity:</h4>
<p>Since every man belongs to a particular religion he prays god, goes to temples and visits holy places. These are religious activities.</p>
<p>So all these physical, political, social and religious activities are non economic activities.</p>
<h3>Distinction between economic and non-economic activities :</h3>
<p>	The following is a brief summary of the distinction between economic and non – economic activities.</p>

<p>Q 2: 	Explain the wealth definition?</p>
<h2>introduction</h2>
<p>	Many economists have defined economics in different ways. There is no universal accepted definition for economics. There are different views with regard to definitions of economics. All definition of economics can be conveniently classified into 4 categories. They are </p>
<ol>
<li>1. Wealth definition</li>
<li>2. Welfare definition</li>
<li>3. Scarcity definition</li>
<li>4. Growth definition.</li>
</ol>
 <h2> definition</h2>
<dl>
<dt>wealth definition</dt>
<dd>Adam Smith and his followers J.B. Sey, Walker and others have defined economics as “science of wealth”. They have given much importance to wealth hence definition is known as wealth definition.</dd>
<dt>wealth definition</dt>
<dd>1. Adam Smith the father of economics defined economics as “an enquire into nature and causes of wealth of nations.” According to him economics is nothing but the study of wealth. In his opinion economics deals with the main question of how wealth is produced and distributed.</dd>
<dt>wealth definition</dt>
<dd>2. According to J.B. Say “Economics is the study of laws which govern wealth”.</dl>
<dt>wealth definition</dt>
<dd>3. According to Prof. Walker “Economics is that body of knowledge which relates to wealth”.</dd>
<dt>wealth definition</dt>
<dd>4. According to J.S. Mill “Economics investigation in to the nature of wealth and the laws of production and distribution”.</dd>
</dl>
<h3> important points</h3>
<p>	The main features of these definitions are may be stated as follows.</p>
<p>1. Economics is the subject that studies the production and distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>2. Wealth means material things only services were excluded from the definition of the term.</p>
<p>3. Wealth definition suggests ways and means to increase the production of material goods or wealth.</p>
<p>4. Self interest is the guiding principle of human beings. So economic man was created by wealth definition.</p>
<h3>Criticism :</h3>
<p> Wealth definition was severely criticised by philosophers and intellectuals like Ruskin, Carlyle etc. It is on the following grounds.</p>
<p>1. This definition gave too much importance to wealth ignoring man. Therefore Carlyle and Ruskin  considered economics to be a selfish science. A science of bread and butter. They also described economics as “Gosper of  mammon worship” or “Decimal science”. Because its main aim is to teach people how to acquire wealth.</p>
<p>2. The meaning and scope of wealth was confined to material goods only. Non material goods on services were excluded from the definitions of wealth.</p>
<p>3. This definition promotes greed and selfishness among the people.</p>
<p>4. Economic welfare was neglected.</p>
<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
<p>Thus the above definition was regarded as very unsatisfactory. It is therefore rejected</p>
<p>Q 3: 	Explain the welfare definition?</p>
<h3>Introduction :</h3>
<p>	Alfred Marshall tried to rectify the defects of wealth definition. Marshall said that wealth is a means to satisfy human wants and not just an end in itself. Marshall emphasised that wealth is for man and man is not wealth. Further he said “Economics is on the one side a study of wealth and on the other and more important side a part of the study of man”. Thus Marshall give primary place to man and secondary place to wealth.</p>
<h3>Definition : </h3>
<dl>
<dt>welfare definition</dt>
<dd>1. According to Marshall “ Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life. It examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well being.”</dd>
<dt>welfare definition</dt>
<dd>2. According AC Pigou “ The range of our enquiry become restricted to that part of social welfare that can be brought directly or indirectly into relation with the measuring rod of money”.</dd>
<dt>welfare definition</dt>
<dd>3. According to Sir William Beveridge “ Economics is the study of general methods by which man cooperate to meet their material needs.”</dd> 
</dl>
<h4>Features of Marshall’s definition :</h4>
<p>	The main features of Marshall’s definition is as follows.</p>
<h1>1. A study of mankind:</h1>
<p>Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life. It means that economics studies economic activities of man. Economics does not study the social, political or religious aspects of human behaviour. Ordinary business of life here means man’s activities in the market place as a producer and consumer of wealth.</p>
<h2>2. Study of individual and social action:</h2>
<p>Economics studies the personal and social activities of man which are concerned with his material welfare.</p>
<h3>3. Study of material welfare:</h3>
<p>The emphasis of Marshall’s definition is on material welfare. The study of non-material welfare is outside the scope of economics.</p>
<h4> 4. A normative science:</h4>
<p>  According to this definition economics is the study of causes effecting material welfare. It is therefore a social science.</p>
 <h4>Criticism:</h4>
<p>Marshall’s definition has been criticized by Robbin’s on the following grounds.</p>
<p>1. Marshall says that welfare depends on material things alone. But it equally depends on non-material things like services of doctors, teachers etc. These services also promote human welfare. So economics is concerned not only with material goods but also with non-material goods.</p>
<p>2. Marshall says that economics is concerned with only those economic activities which can promote welfare. But the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol will ruin the welfare. Yet they come under the preview of economics. Because they can satisfy human wants.</p>
<p>3. Marshall has established relationship between economics and welfare. But according to Robbin’s there is no relationship between economics and welfare.</p>
<p>4. The idea of welfare is based on cardinal utility. Utility is a psychological feeling of satisfaction. In reality we cannot measure the welfare with the help of cardinal numbers.</p>
<p>5. If we accept welfare definition an economist should say whether a particular want promotes welfare or not.</p>
<p>	But Robbin’s says that economics is not concerned with welfare. It is not the duty of an economist to say that whether a particular want promotes welfare or not. So Robbin’s says that economist should remain neutral between ends.</p>
<p>Q 4: Explain the scarcity definition of economics ?</p>
<h5>Introduction:</h5>
<p>	Wealth and welfare definitions found to be too narrow in its scope and unscientific. So Lionel Robbin’s has advanced his own definition of economics in his book “An essay on the nature and significance of economic science.” He introduced scarcity definition of economics.</p>
<h4>Definition:</h4>
<dl>
<dt> scarcity definition</dt> 
<dd> According to Robbin’s “Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scare means which have alternative uses”.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>
Important points:</h4>
<p>Robbin’s definition sets out the following important points.</p>
<h2>1. Unlimited wants:</h2>
<p>Here ends refer to wants. Human wants are unlimited we cannot satisfied another want arises. If human wants are limited there is no economic problem.</p>
<h2>2. Scarce means:</h2>
<p>Means refer to resources wants are unlimited but the means which satisfy human wants are limited. If all things are available in abundance just like fresh air there are no economic problems. But the economic problems arise because of unlimited wants and limited means or resources.</p>
<h3>3. Means have alternative uses:</h3>
<p>Means are not only scarce but also they have different uses. They can be put a number of uses, For example a piece of land can be used for growing rice, wheat or sugarcane etc. So scarce means can be used for different purposes.</p>
<h4>4. Choice among wants:</h4>
<p>We cannot satisfy all over wants with limited means. We choose those wants that are considered urgent, only after satisfying them we consider less urgent wants.</p>
     <p>	Hence many economic problems arise because of unlimited wants, scarcity of means, the means are capable of being put to alternative uses and making a choice.</p>
<h2>Superiority if Robbin’s Definition :</h2>
<p>	Robbin’s claims that his definition is superior to the earlier definitions on the following grounds.</p>
<p>1. Scarcity definition is more scientific. Since it is not based on artificial classification of wants as material and non-material. It is independent of such classification.</p>
<p>2. As defined by Robbin’s economics has a much wider rate. It takes into account all types of human wants, material and non-material, as well as of all types of persons whether they are living in the society or not.</p>
<p>3. Marshall had restricted economics to wealth and activities which are related to the material welfare of man only. But Robbin’s greatly widened the scope of economics. So it is universal in application.</p>
<p>4. Robbin’s claims that conception which he adopted to analytical.</p>
<p>5. Robbin’s made economics as a positive science. Economists are pure scientists. There business is to explore and explain. They shall not prescribe policies. They must remain neutral between ends.</p>
<h3>Criticism :</h3>
<p>	Robbin’s definition is criticized on the following grounds.</p>
<p>1. It is pointed out that although Robbin's declaims so much against the welfare definition. Yet the concept of welfare is implicit even in his own definition.</p>
<p>2. The neutral attitude of the scarcity definition towards ends is not accepted by some marshalian economists. They consider the scarcity definition is too narrow and restricted in scope for a social study like economics.</p>
<p>3. The scarcity definition converts economics into a pure science. A science that is concerned with the formulation of economic generalisations having little or nothing to do in practice.</p>
 <p>4. It is pointed out by the critics that an economic problem does not always arise from scarcity as suggested by Robbin’s. It can arise from abundance as well.</p>
<p>5. The greatest defect of Robbin’s definition as pointed out by critics is that it is static in content and as such suffers from inadequateness.</p>
<p>	In a dynamic society like that of ours even the ends and the means are subject to change. But Robbin’s definition neglects or over looks this aspects.</p>
<p>Q 5 : 	Define growth definition of economics. Explain how this definition is superior than other definition ?</p>
<h4>Introduction :</h4>
<p>		Robbin’s definition is static in nature. The wants achievements and means change as the time changes. 		As the time passes the scarcity of means, ends, targets, choices undergo a change so Samuelson proposes a dynamic definition in place of Robbin’s static definition.</p>
<h4>Definition:</h4>
<dl>
<dt> definition  by samuel about scarcity</dt>
<dd>According to  Samuelson “Economics is the study of how people and society ends up choosing with or without the use of money to employ scarce productive resources that could have alternative uses to produce various commodities and distribute them for consumption now or in the future among various persons and groups in the society. Economics analyzes the costs and benefits of improving patterns of resource use.”</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Important points :</h4>
<p>The points to be noted in the  definition of Samuelson are </p>
<h4>1. Scarcity:</h4>
<p>Like Robbin’s, Samuelson accepts the scarcity of resources, unlimited wants and the alternative uses for the means.</p>
<h2>2. Dynamism:</h2>
<p>Samuelson definition is dynamic. He talks about production, distribution and consumption of goods in the  present and also in the future. The importance of time is thus brought into his definition by Samuelson.</p>
<h3>3. Wide Scope:</h3>
<p>Samuelson’s definition is not only dynamic but also it is wide in scope. His definition makes it very clear that the problem of choice can exist not only in a monitory economy but also in a barter economy.</p>
   <h4>4. Economic growth:</h4>
<p> Samuelson gave importance to economic growth, with the passage of time there will be more wants and hence more goods will be produced and distributed for present consumption and future consumption. The later is safeguard by productive investment which leads to economic growth.</p>
<h1>Superiority:</h1>
<p>Samuelson definition is superior than other definition in the following aspects.</p>
 <p>1. Samuelson’s definition is comprehensive.</p>
<p>2. It explains the dynamic change in the economy.</p>
<p>3. It explains the economic activities in a barter economy and monitory economy.</p>
<p>4. It also explains the problem of choice.</p>
<h1>Conclusion :</h1>
<p>Samuelson’s definition explains the problem of choice dynamic conditions. His definition is applicable at all times and in all types of economic systems. So it gained popularity.</p>
<p>Q 6 :	Distinguish between micro economics and macro economics ? Explain the interdependence between them ?</p>
<h1>Introduction :</h1>
<p>The subject matter of economics was classified by modern economists into 2 parts. They are</p>
<ul type="A">
<li>1. Micro Economics.</li>
<li>2. Macro Economics.</li>
</ul>
<p> These two terms were first used by Ragnar frisch. Micro economics was popularised by Marshall & Macro economics was popularised by JM Keynes. Micro economics is also called price theory and Macro economics is also known as income and employment theory.</p>
<h1>Meaning of Micro economics :</h1>
<p>The term micro is derived from  the Greek word “mikros” meaning small. Micro economics is therefore the study of small parts of the economy.</p>
<h1>Definition :</h1>
<dl>
<dt>definition of micro economics</dt>
<dd>According K.E. Boulding “Micro economics is the study of particular firms, particular households, individual prices, wages, incomes, individual industries and particular commodities.</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Explanation :</h1>
<p>Micro economics studies the economic motives and behaviour of individual consumers and producers and the principles involved in organising and operating individual firms and industries. It studies how individual consumer, firm, industry attain equilibrium. It also tries to explain price determination of individual commodities and factors of production. So micro economics is also called price theory.</p>
<h1>Meaning of Macro economics :</h1>
<p>The term Macro is derived from  the Greek word “Makros” meaning large. Macro economics is the study of the economic system as a whole.</p>
<h2>Definition of Macro economics :</h2>  
<dl>
<dt>definition of macro economics</dt>
<dd>According to K.E. Boulding “Macro economics need not with individual quantities as such, but with aggregates of the quantities, not with the individual in errors but with the national income, not with individual price but with in the general price level, not with individual outputs but with the national output.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Explanation :</h2>
<p>Macro economics is concerned with aggregates and averages of entire economy. It studies not individual economic units like the consumer or produce or firm industry but the whole economic system. It deals with the aggregates the national output, aggregate employment, total consumption total investment, aggregate demand, aggregate supply and general price level etc.</p>
 <p>Q 7 :	Differences between Micro economics and Macro economics ?</p>
<p>	The following are the important differences between micro economics and macro economics.</p>

<td>Macro means large. It studies the behaviour of the economy.</td>
<td>It studies the problems related to full employment and economic growth.</td>
<td>National income business cycles. General price level, the aggregate demand, aggregate supply. Total savings and total investments etc.</td>
<td>Macro economics is relatively more complexity in it’s nature when compared to micro economics.</td>
<td>J.M. Keynes
 <td>We need aggregate supply function and aggregate demand function to know the level of employment under micro economics.</td>
</tr>
<p>	The following are the important differences between micro economics and macro economics.</p>
<p>Interdependence of micro economics and macro economics : Although there are some important differences between micro & macro economics we should not treat them as separate and independent branches of study. Micro economics and macro economics are interdependent. Parts effect the whole and the whole effects the parts. To analyse micro economic problems analysis of macro economic is necessary. Similarly micro economic analysis is necessary for macro economic problems.</p>
<h1>Examples of interdependence of micro economics and macro economic problems :</h1>
<h1>a) Dependence of micro economics on macro economics :</h1>
<p>The problem of the quantity of sales of a firm is a micro problem. But it depends on total income, total employment, aggregate demand etc. Which belongs to macro economics. Therefore we cannot assess changes in individual units without analyzing the behaviour of aggregates.</p>
<h2>b) Dependence of macro economics on micro economics :</h2>
<p>In macro economics we study total production total income etc but total production is the sum total of production of individual firms and total income is the sum total of individual incomes. Therefore without analyzing the behaviour of individual firms, individual income etc. We cannot exactly assess the behaviour of total production and total income.</p>
<h2>Conclusion :</h2>
<p>Thus to gain a complete insight into the working of the economy the two approaches are necessary.</p>
<p>As Samuelson says you are only half educated if you understand one while being ignorant of the other.</p>
<p>Q 8 : 	Explain the methods of economic investigation ?</p>
<h2>Introduction :</h2>
<p> Every scientist follows certain methods in the formulation of principles, laws and theorems. It is the business of the economist as of every other scientist to collect facts, to arrange and interpret them and to draw conclusions. These are the devices for the discovery of relations between cause and effect. The economist thus uses the same methodology employed by the scientist. The term methodology refers to the techniques and procedures used by the economist to acquire the knowledge and understanding the economic process. It has to do with techniques employed in both consumption and verification of economic principles. There are two well known methods of scientific investigation. They are</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Deductive method</li>
<li>2. Inductive method</li>
</ul>
<h1>1. Deductive method:</h1>
<p> To proceed reasoning from general to the particular or from the universal to the individual is called deductive logic. Deductive method is also known as analytical method or abstract methods. It involves certain steps :</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Formulation of assumptions or Hypothesis.</li>
<li>2. Drawing conclusions.</li>
<li>3. Verification of conclusions.</li>
</ul> 
<p>	For instance everybody knows that the utility derived by an individual from a commodity or service goes on diminishing with every additional unit of consumption. This is the essence of the law of diminishing marginal utility. From this observation the following subsidiary theorems can be derived. The more stock of a commodity one passes lower will be the utility of the additional stocks obtained. Money is not an exception to this. This implies that the rich people derive lower amount of utility from an incremental increase in their wealth based on this a specific conclusion can be drawn that taxation policy should be based on the basis of progression than on fixed percentage or proportionate basis.</p>
<h1>Merits :</h1>
<p>The following are the merits of deductive method</p> 
<h1>1. Simple method:</h1>
<p>It is a simple approach from a few basic facts of human nature. A human of interferences (laws) can be drawn by logical reasoning.</p>
<h2>2. Reasonable scope for experimentation:</h2>  
<p>It is not  possible for the economist to conduct control on experiments in a laboratory. He can therefore fall back upon deductive reasoning.</p>
<h3>3. Logic and reasoning based:</h3>
<p>  This method uses logic and reasoning and hence the results are likely to be accurate and exact.</p>
<h1>Demerits:</h1>
<p>There are some demerits of deductive method.</p>
<h1>1. Assumptions :</h1>
<p>Many economic laws are based on certain assumptions the theories arrived at by deductive reasoning or valid only under assumed conditions. The assumptions must also be valid. If the theories are to be held good.</p>
<h2>2. Too abstract :</h2>
<p>Confirming to the abstract approach may not result in meaningful analysis.</p>  
<h3>3. Poor evidence :</h3>
<p>  It may not be capable of generating adequate evidence to claim universally valid laws.</p>
<h1>Inductive method:</h1>
<p>Induction is the process of a reasoning from particular facts to general from a part to the whole or from the individual to the universe. The inductive method also known as historical method empirical (practical) method.Inductive method involves.</p>
<ul type="A">
<li>a) Observations.</li>
<li>b) Formation of hypothesis.</li>
<li>c) Generalisation and</li>
<li>d) Verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eg: Angles law of consumption.</p>
<p>	For example Angel announced his famous law of family expenditure. After careful observation and study of budgets of different families. (When income of the individual increases then expenditure incurred on food grains decreases.)</p>
<h1>Merits :</h1>
<h1>1. It is more realistic:</h1>
<p>Inductive method is based on facts observed and collected. It describes things as they are. Therefore it is more realistic and practical.</p>
<h2>2. It is dynamic:</h2>
<p>Economic phenomena are ever changing. Inductive method analyzes the new experiences, new facts.</p>
<h3>3. It helps future enquiries:</h3>   
<p>The inductive method discovers and proves general principle. Thus it helps future investigations.</p>
<h1>Demerits of inductive method:</h1>
<p>Inductive method has some demerits also.</p>
<h1>1. Hurried conclusions:</h1>
<p>In inductive method there is a danger that hasty and hurried conclusions will be drawn from insufficient number of facts.</p>
<h2>2. Expensive and complex:</h2>
<p>The collection of adequate data about the specifies may be an expensive, complex and time consuming process.</p>
<h3>3. Not certain:</h3>
<p>The conclusions drawn from this method are not certain. As bounding pointed out that statistical information can only give us proportions whose truth is more or less probable. It never gives us certainty.</p>
<p>Q 9 : 	Is economics a science or an art ?</p>
<h1> Meaning of science:</h1>
<p>Science is defined as a systemised body of knowledge. A science has to satisfy certain prerequisites namely</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Ability to establish casual relationship between variables.</li>
<li>2. Measurability</li>
<li>3. Universal validity.</li>
<li>4. Predictability.</li>
</ol>
<p>	By applying the above tests to the subject of economics. We can find out whether it is a science or not.</p>
<h1>1. Causation:</h1>
<p>Economics like any other subject is the study of systematised body of knowledge establishing the cause and effect relationship among the variables. For example the law of demand states that other things remaining constant the price and quantity demanded or inversely related. One can notice a casual relation between price and quantity demanded. Here price is the cause white the quantity demanded is the effect.</p>
<h2>2. Measurability:</h2>
<p>  Money is used in economics as an instrument to test and verify the economic phenomena.</p>
<h3>3. Universal validity:</h3>     
<p>There are some laws or theories in economics that can claim universal validity. Who can dispute the law of diminishing marginal utility and the law of diminishing marginal returns. These are the laws which are universally valid.</p>
<h4>4. Predictability:</h4>
<p>Economics do provide scope fr predictability. Economists generally make use of the tools supplied by decisive sciences like mathematics and statistics and try to predict into the future. For example Demand forecasting. <br>	Since all the prerequisites of a science are satisfied by economics. So it can be called as science.</p>
 <h5>5. Controversy among economists:</h5>
<p>Unfortunately many scholars disagree in considering economics as a science. According to them economics cannot be treated on par with general sciences like physics or chemistry whose laws are definite and certain. H2SO4 gives sulphuric acid. Whether the experiment is made in India or Canada or Australia. But the same cannot be claimed in case of economics. Most of the economic theories are hypothetical. Hence cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.</p>
<h6>6. Economics as an art:</h6>
<p>The application of scientific laws to find solutions to practical problems is called an art.<br>	Should economics be an art. Here economists were divided.</p>
   <h1>Controversy among economist:</h1>
<p>Alfred Marshall who does not want the scientific status of economics to be disturbed, expressed that economics is only a science but not an art.<br> 	His perception was that when economic theories are to be put to practical application to offer solutions it may give rise to differences of opinion that may impair the scientific status of the subject of economics.</p>
 <p>	J.M. Keynes on the other hand states that economics is an art. What is fun of having a science when it cannot be applied to the practical problems ? According to him difference in perceptions in finding the solutions is the strength rather than the weakness of economics. Hence economics is an art.</p>
<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
 <p>To conclude that the science of economics lays down precepts (laws) and the art of economics makes use of the precepts to find solutions. Therefore economics is both a science as well as an art.</p>
<p>Q 10 :	Economics a positive science or a normative science.</p>
<h1>Meaning of positive science :</h1>
<p>Positive science mainly explains what is it deals with things as they are and explains cause and effect without taking value judgements whether it is right or wrong. In other words positive science only describe things as they actually are. It is concerned with actual. It deals with theoretical aspects. Thus positive science may be called as pure science.</p>
<h2>Meaning of normative science:</h2>
<p>Normative science is concerned with what ought to be or should be. It is concerned with the ideals. It explains whether a thing is good or bad. It lays down policies and rules to achieve what is considered to be good. It evaluates the things. Thus normative science may be called as applied science.</p>
<h1>	For example:</h1>
<p>When we analyze the causes of poverty economics becomes a positive science. But is we discuss whether poverty is good or bad and what policies should be followed to remove poverty then economics becomes a normative science.</p>
<p>	According to Robbin’s and his followers economics is a positive science and therefore it is neutral between ends. The economist is not concerned with whether the ends are good or bad. The economist should only say what consequences are likely to follow with certain actions. He should not say whether these actions are desirable or not. For example : Economist should simply say that wine satisfies a human want and therefore it has utility. But he should not say that drinking of wine is bad. <br>	But now-a-days the practical utility of the subject has increased considerably. Economist speaks also about what is good and what is bad. Thus economics is a positive science and a normative science.</p>
 <p>Q 11 :	Explain the law of diminishing marginal utility ?</p>
<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The law of diminishing marginal utility is an important law in consumption. It was propound by H.H. Gossen so it is known as Gossen’s first law. This law was explained by Alfred Marshall. It is based on the common experience of every consumer. This law is based on the fact that a particular want is stable. Thus law explains the fact that as we go on consuming a commodity the satisfaction derived from its additional units goes on diminishing therefore it is called the law of diminishing marginal utility. Broadly speaking this law explains the functional relationship between the stock of a commodity and its marginal utility.</p>
<h1>Definition:</h1>
<dl>
<dt>definition</dt>
<dd>Marshall defines this law as “ The additional benefit which a person derives from a given increase of his stock of a thing, diminishes with every increase in the stock that he already has.”</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Example:</h1>
<p>When a consumer is consuming mangoes one after the other. 1st mango gives him more satisfaction. 2nd mango gives him less satisfaction than 1st. 3rd mango gives less satisfaction than 2nd. After consuming some mangoes his desire for consuming mangoes are fully satisfied. After that also if he is consuming one more mango it gives him negative satisfaction or dissatisfaction.</p>
<h1>Schedule:</h1>
<p>The law of diminishing marginal utility we can explain with the help of the following schedule.</p>
<h1>No. of Mangoes		Total utility		Marginal utility</h1>
<ul>
<li>	1				10			10</li>
<li>	2				18			8</li>
<li>	3				23			5</li>
<li>	4				24			1</li>
<li>	5				24			0</li>
<li>	6				22			-2</li>
</ul>
<h1>Explanation:</h1>
<p>	In the above schedule the consumer is shown to be consuming mangoes one after the other. When consumer is consuming more mangoes his total utility is increasing up to four mangoes at 5th mango the total utility is maximum or constant. The total utility of the 6th mango diminishes.<br>	When consumer is consuming more number of mangoes his marginal utility diminishes up to 4 mangoes at 5th mango marginal utility is zero. It indicates that his desire for consuming mangoes are fully satisfied. At 6th mango marginal utility becomes negative.</p>
<h1>Diagram:</h1>
<p>This law may be illustrated by means of a diagram.Diagram – 1</p>
<p> In the above diagram a number of mangoes are shown on x-axis and total utility is shown on y-axis. TU is the total utility curve it goes upwards from left to right up to point p. At point p it is constant later it diminishes. In the below diagram B number of mangoes are shown on x-axis and marginal utility is shown on y-axis. MU is the marginal utility curve. It is sloping downwards from left to right up to point Q. At point Q it cuts OX axis after that the MU curve indicate negative satisfaction or dissatisfaction.</p>
<h1>Relationship between total utility and marginal utility :</h1>
<p>1. When consumer is consuming mangoes his total utility increases then his marginal utility decreases.</p>
<p>2. When total utility is maximum than marginal utility becomes zero.</p>
<p>3. When total utility diminishes or decreases then marginal utility becomes negative.</p>
<h1>Assumptions:</h1>
<p>The law of diminishing marginal utility is based on the following assumptions.</p>
<h1>1. Units of reasonable size:</h1>
<p>The units of the commodity must be of the reasonable size. The unit should not be too big or too small. If it is too big or too small, this law will not operate.</p>
<h2>2. Identical units:</h2>
<p>All the units of a commodity must be of the same quality. They must be identical in all respects. If there is any difference in the quality of the commodity this law may not operate.</p>
<h3>3. No time interval:</h3>
<p>There should not be any time gap between the consumption of one unit and the other unit. The consumption of the units of a commodity should be continuous.</p>
<h4>4. No change in the tastes:</h4>
<p>The tastes of the consumer should not change during the period of consumption. If there is a change in the tastes of the consumer this law may not operate.</p>
<h5>5. Rationality:</h5>
<p>The consumer is assumed to be a rational economic man whose behaviour is normal and one who is aiming at maximization of satisfaction.</p>
     <h6>6. Cardinal measurement of utility:</h6>
<p>It is assumed that utility can be numerically expressed by the consumer.</p>
<h1>Exceptions:</h1>
<h1>1. Hobbies:</h1>
<p>This law will not apply in the case of hobbies like collection of postage stamps, old coins etc. as the number of stamps and coins increases the marginal utility will be increasing instead of diminishing.</p>
<h1>2. Drunkards:</h1>
<p>It is said that this law is not applicable to a drunkard because he gets more satisfaction by drinking additional pegs of liquor.</p>
<h3>3. Misers:</h3>
<p>It is pointed out that this law does not apply to a miser. The more money a miser has the greater is the satisfaction that he derives.</p>
<h4>4. Music:</h4>
<p>It is said that in the case of music this law may not apply. A music lover gets more satisfaction by hearing more music.</p>
<h5>5. Reading:</h5>
<p>More reading gives more knowledge hence a scholar could get more and more satisfaction with every additional book.</p>
<p>Q 12:	Explain the law of equi-marginal utility?</p>
<h1>Introduction :</h1>
<p> The law equi – marginal utility was proponed by H.H. Gossen so it is known Gossen’s second law. This law was explained by Alfred Marshall. This law explains how a consumer distributes his limited income among various goods. In other words this law explains consumer’s equilibrium. (A consumer is in equilibrium position when he gets maximum satisfaction from his limited income).</p>
<h1>Definition:</h1>
<dl>
<dt> definition of equi marginal utility</dt>
<dd> Professor Marshall has stated this law as follows. “If a person has a thing which can be put to several uses he will distribute it between these uses in such a way that it has the same marginal utility in all”.</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Explanation of the law :</h1>
<p> The consumer spends money on different commodities by comparing their marginal utilities. If he finds that a rupee spent on commodity A gives him greater utility than commodity B. He will purchase the commodity A only. In other words he substitutes a high utility commodity for a law utility article. He will goes on substituting one commodity for another till the marginal utilities of both the commodities become equal. Hence this principle is called the law of maximum satisfaction.<br>A person derives maximum satisfaction when the marginal utilities of all commodities purchased are equalised that is why it is called doctrine of maximum satisfaction.</p>
       <h1>Schedule:</h1>
<p>The law of equi marginal utility can be clearly explained with the help of the following example schedule. Suppose a consumer has with him Rs. 5 and he wants to spend it on two commodities A and B. The price of each good is Rs. 1 the marginal utilities of A and B are given in the table below.</p>
<table class="a">
<caption>money spent on marginal utility of A and B</caption>
<tr>
<th> money spent</th>
<th> marginal utility of a </th>
<th> marginal utility  of B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1st rupee</td>
<td>2nd rupee</td>
<td>3rd rupee</td>
<td> 4th rupee</td>
<td> 5th rupee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 25 units</td>
<td> 20 units</td>
<td> 15 units</td>
<td>10 units</td>
<td>5 units</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 units</td>
<td> 15 units </td>
<td> 10 units</td>
<td> 5 units</td>
<td> 1 unit </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the above schedule 1st column shows money spent, 2nd column shows marginal utility derived from commodity A and 3rd column shows marginal utility derived from commodity B.</p>
<p>If the consumer spends 3 Rs. On commodity A and Rs. 2 on commodity B. The marginal utilities derived from both the commodities are equal. The satisfaction derived is also maximum at that point.</p>
<p>	The utility derived from commodity A is 25+20+15=60 units and the utility derived from commodity B is 20+15 = 35 units. The total satisfaction derived from both the commodities are 60+35=95 units. It can be seen that no other combination will give him such maximum satisfaction. So 3 units of A + 2 units of B is the best combination which consumer can purchase with his limited income of Rs. 5. The last rupee spent on A and B will give the same marginal utility then the consumer is in equilibrium.</p>
<h1>Diagram:</h1>
<p>The law of equi – marginal utility can be explained with the help of the following diagram.</p>
<p> In the above diagram money spent is shown on ox – axis. Marginal utility derived from the commodities A and B are shown on oy – axis.</p>
<p>In the above diagram marginal utility of A is shown by A curve. The marginal utility of B is shown by B curve. The marginal utility of A is RT the marginal utility of B is PS. Both are equal. The amount spent on A is OT. The amount spent on B is OS. Now we have taken only two goods even when we make a change in number of goods this principle operates as usual.</p>
<h1>Assumptions:</h1>
<p>The law of equi – marginal utility is based on the following assumptions.</p>
<p>1. It is assumed that the consumer is a rational person. He tries to get maximum satisfaction from his limited income.</p>
<p>2. It is also assumed that the utility is measurable in cardinal terms.</p>
<p>3. The consumer has a fixed income.</p>
<p>4. The prices of goods are constant.</p>
<p>5. The consumer knows all the utilities he can derive from different goods.</p>
<p>6. The goods are desirable and can be substituted for one another.</p>
<h1>Limitations:</h1>
<p>The law of equi – marginal utility has certain limitations.</p>
<h1>1. Indivisibility of goods:</h1>
<p>This law applies only to those goods which are desirable into very small units. When goods are indivisible it is not possible to equate the marginal utilities.</p>
<h2>2. Ignorance:</h2>
<p>If a person is ignorant he will not be able to make good use of his money.</p>
<h3>3. Customs and fashions:</h3>
<p>If a person follows customs and fashions he will not be able to spend money wisely.</p>
<h4>4. Measurability of utility:</h4>
<p>This law depends upon the assumptions of measurability of utility. But utility is a subjective concept it cannot be quantitatively measured.</p>
<h5>5. Calculation of utilities:</h5>
<p>  In real life we have to purchase number of goods and services. Therefore it is not possible to calculate and compare the marginal utilities and equate them.</p>
<h1>Short notes:</h1>
<h1>1. Cardinal utility  ?</h1>
<p> Number like 1,2,3 are described as cardinal numbers. Some of the economists measured utility with an imaginary measure called unit or utility. Marshall measured it indirectly through the money price offered. Utility is here measured with the help of cardinal numbers. Therefore it is called cardinal utility.</p>
<h2>2. Ordinal utility ?</h2>
<p> Ordinal utility is based on the assumptions that utility cannot be measured even indirectly but can only be compared numbers like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th are called ordinal numbers. The ordinal concept permits us to say only the preference of the consumer in relation to different goods or different combination of goods.</p>
